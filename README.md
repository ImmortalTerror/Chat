# Chat V3.9.2

This is a chat system made using batch.

## First time using

The first time you run it, it will ask you to make an admin account. Do as it says and it will work. I recommend making the "info" folder hidden. To do this right click, then go to properties and click "hidden".

# How to use

You just simply type in one window and it will update in the other. You can use /help to see a list of commands. Discriminatory words are censored and there is slight spam protection.

# Credits

This was mostly made by me but the youtuber Technology Crazier made the encryption method. I also must thank the great community of [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for the amazing help. This has been my biggest project yet and i have learned so much from this and had a lot of fun.
